# Introduction
We are eCare and we care. We are a group of 5 that built an application that represents walk-in clinics. The application has many different features, such as adding services, booking an appointment, rating a service, etc. This app was built using Android Studio, Java and Firebase. This app took about 3 month to develop and incorporated many things that we learnt from our studies. It introduced us to app development and UI design.
