# Introduction
We are eCare and we care. We are a group of 5 that built an application that represents walk-in clinics. The application has many different features, such as adding services, booking an appointment, rating a service, etc. This app was built using Android Studio, Java and Firebase. This app took about 3 month to develop and incorporated many things that we learnt from our studies. It introduced us to app development and UI design.

# Lessons learned
Many lessons were learned during the duration of this project. These lessons ranged from app development to effective teamwork. One of the lessons we learned was how to effectively apply our previous knowledge into something new, like developing an application. At first sight, one might think that everything we've learnt (ITI 1120 and 1121) would not apply to app development on Android Studio. However, after we started learning Android Studio and app development, many of the concepts we learnt in our studies were useful when solving problem for this application. Another lesson pertaining to the actual development was the importance of both UI, UX and functionality. Prior to this app, many members of the group mostly focused on functionality (our ITI assigments). However, during the development of this application, it became noticable that, yes, although functionality is crucial, a good UI and an enjoyable UX is just as important. A working app is a must; however, without a good UI and UX, it is basically useless as the UI is what connects the user to the application. An enjoyable UX encourages the user to use the app more, which is always good. It also permits the user to compleye whatever work they wanted to do with the app.

Another important lesson we learned was effective teamwork. Although all of us has done group projects before, not all of us was apart of a project like this. This project involved all of us learning a new tool. We each had to show our strengths and help each other wherever we encountered a weakness. It was crucial that we split up the work in a way where each member would be comfortable and excel but also be challenged. We learnt that although this project was for marks and that we needed to do good on it, it was important we all gained something from it. 

Overall, this project was a great experience. It taught us alot on app development but also on how to work with new tools and in a group. The experience/skills we gained will without a doubt assist us in future projects.
